Dynamic DNS with Cloudflare

Have a domain pointed at Cloudflare nameservers.
Have API key and email exported as CLOUDFLARE_API and CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL.

Requirements:

    * python (2)
    * requests

OSX:

    * Use launchd to trigger update when network location changes:

        /path/to/cfdns --plist DOMAIN NAME > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/location_change.plist
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/location_change.plist # or logout/login

LINUX:

    * Use network manager to update when network location changes (sweet):

        /path/to/cfdns --nm DOMAIN NAME > /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99ddns
        chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99ddns

    * Use cron to check/update on a fixed schedule (lame):

        */15 * * * * /path/to/cfdns --ddns DOMAIN NAME
